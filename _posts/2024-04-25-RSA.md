title: RSA - Collection of Formulas
tags: CTF Crypto RSA

Within this very short post I want to create a collection of formulas that are used within the RSA algorithm which as an asymmetric encryption algorithm.

## private values
- prime numbers `p`, `q`
- the value of `phi(n)` which is calculated as `phi(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)`
- private (decryption) key: `d`

## public values
- public (encryption) key: `e`
- the value of `n` which is calculated as `n = p * q`

## restrictions for the key values
- the public key `e` has a value between `1` and `phi(n) - 1`
- the public key `e` is coprime to `phi(n)`
- the private key `d` is the multiplicative inverse of `e` with respect to `phi(n)` which results in the following equation: `e * d = 1 (mod phi(n))`

## encryption
`c = m^e (mod n)`

## decryption
`m = c^d (mod n)`
